            I've tried to showcase my skills and experience as best I can in my resume, although it's impossible to
            fully cover who I am and what I can do in a single page.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            While I am a specialist, the nature of my work means I have to be a generalist as well. Thus, I dabble in a
            lot of different domains in my spare time, including graphic design / UI.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            For this resume, for example, I've tried to emulate the style of handmade dinner plates, from my love of
            cooking. I've therefore chosen a speckled off-white background, a terracotta accent color, and a font that,
            while very legible, has a slight freehand feel to it.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            Recently, I've also made my own Visual Studio Code theme, which you can find on <a
                href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=martinmeneval.m1okai">the VSCode
                Marketplace</a>.

        <div class="block">While I love learning new skills, and deep-diving into fresh domains, I'm by and
            large not a web developer. I wanted to keep this personal home page as simple as possible, for ease
            of
            developement and maintenance.

        <div class="block">As such, I'm using the <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma CSS framework</a>, and the website
            itself is running through
